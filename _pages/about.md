I am a third year [Ph.D. Student](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/spalta) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/) where I am advised by [Professor Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io).

I am a member of the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP)](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) Lab in [UMIACS](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu). 

My research interests broadly lie in the areas of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing with a focus on Commonsense Reasoning, Explainability and Interpretability, and Bias and Fairness in NLP. 

I got my Master of Science in Computer Science from UMD in 2023. Before coming to Maryland, I graduated from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/index.aspx) in 2021 with a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

During my time at BITS Pilani, I was a Research Assistant at the [Maryland Information and Network Dynamics (MIND) Lab](http://mindlab.cs.umd.edu) at the University of Maryland, College Park where I researched on algorithms for contact tracing for COVID-19, and on time-series analysis for segmentation of breathing data.
