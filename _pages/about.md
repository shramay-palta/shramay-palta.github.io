I am a [Ph.D. Candidate](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/spalta) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/) where I am advised by [Professor Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io).

I am a member of the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP)](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) Lab in [UMIACS](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu). 

My research interests broadly lie in the areas of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing with a focus on Commonsense Reasoning, Explainability and Interpretability, and Bias and Fairness in NLP. Specifically, I try to explore and understand:

1. Is commonsense reasoning prone to uncertainty?
2. How do humans and language models behave under this uncertainty?
3. Are there cases where models deviate from human values and notions about the real world?

I got my Master of Science in Computer Science from UMD in 2023. Before coming to Maryland, I graduated from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/index.aspx) in 2021 with a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

For Summer 2025, I will be a research intern in the Office AI group at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), where I will be working with Michael Bentley and [Mengting Wan](https://mengtingwan.github.io).
