  title={It's Not Easy Being Wrong: Evaluating Process of Elimination Reasoning in Large Language Models},
  author={Nishant Balepur and Shramay Palta and Rachel Rudinger},
  journal={ArXiv},
  year={2023},
  abstract = "Chain-of-thought (COT) prompting can help large language models (LLMs) reason toward correct answers, but its efficacy in reasoning toward incorrect answers is unexplored. This strategy of process of elimination (PoE), when used with COT, has the potential to enhance interpretability in tasks like medical diagnoses of exclusion. Thus, we propose PoE with COT, a new task where LLMs must reason toward incorrect options on multiple-choice questions. We evaluate the ability of GPT-3.5, LLaMA-2, and Falcon to perform PoE with COT on 2-choice commonsense and scientific reasoning datasets. We show that PoE consistently underperforms directly choosing the correct answer. The agreement of these strategies is also lower than the self-consistency of each strategy. To study these issues further, we conduct an error analysis and give suggestions for future work."

    abstract = "It is common sense that one should prefer to eat a salad with a fork rather than with a chainsaw. However, for eating a bowl of rice, the choice between a fork and a pair of chopsticks is culturally relative. We introduce FORK, a small, manually-curated set of CommonsenseQA-style questions for probing cultural biases and assumptions present in commonsense reasoning systems, with a specific focus on food-related customs. We test several CommonsenseQA systems on FORK, and while we see high performance on questions about the US culture, the poor performance of these systems on questions about non-US cultures highlights systematic cultural assumptions aligned with US over non-US cultures.",
